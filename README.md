The Quantum+AI for Climate project combines quantum computing with AI to tackle climate anomaly detection. By using advanced quantum algorithms like QPE and HHL, EcoQubitiers integrated quantum machine learning with large-scale climate datasets of India, achieving significantly faster anomaly detection compared to classical machine learning methods, all while maintaining high confidence in the results.
